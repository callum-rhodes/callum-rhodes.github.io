By formulating gas distribution mapping as an iterative least-squares problem and applying Gaussian belief propagation (GBP), we show how dense distribution maps can be inferred instantly using only posed sparse concentration measurments. This is demoed in a real-world scenarion onboard a Husky UGV carrying 3 gas concentration sensors at different heights.
