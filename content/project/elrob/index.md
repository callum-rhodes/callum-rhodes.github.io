ELROB: European land robotics trials. From small scale robotics to autonomous vehicles, the ELROB 2022 trials were a series of tests focussing on search and rescue, reconnaissance and autonomy. The team from Loughborough pushed the boundaries and developed a heterogeneous UGV and UAV combo for exploration and radiation mapping. The UGV acted as a drone delivery vehicle and allowed the sensing UAV to move in tight spaces until flying capablilities were required. Real time 3D radiation mapping was demonstrated for the first time here.
