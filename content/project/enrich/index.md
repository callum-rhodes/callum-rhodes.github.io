EnRicH: The European robotics hackathon hosted in Austria. The EnRicH 2021 event was held in Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant and provided a host of challenges including remote manipulation, autonomous exploration and radiation detection & mapping. Lead a team of researchers from Loughborough University in the radiation mapping challenge using a custom semi-autonomous UAV. In the challenge a large shaft had to be traversed and mapped, and a real radiation source found. This project used work from my PhD in order to perform the radiation mapping. Highlights can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7LYBUIATHw&list=PL8pZ0oVAzBk5tZt-sCvzJxr0iSRcVVJXZ&index=5&ab_channel=EuropeanRobotics).
